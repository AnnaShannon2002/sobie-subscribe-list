**As A** random interested in keeping up with sobie | sobie admin

**I want** to subscribe to news

**So that** I know what's happening

This is a repo/project created by Anna and Milly Trejo. 

Here we have worked on the "Subscribe" issue of theSobieCo. The old SOBIE website lacked a newsletter feature therefore, we created a simulation of what one could look like.
We have created pages of what different functions & features would look like; for example we have an "unsubscribe" page, an "already subscribed page", an "email does not exist" page, and input validation.
